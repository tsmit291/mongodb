2. What is a document? How is this different than the way data is stored in an SQL database?

In a document database, the smallest unit is a document. Documents are stored in a collection and that collection makes up a database. The best part is that documents are basically rows in an SQL table, but not every document needs to have the same structure. Each of them can have different fields and that is useful for many reasons.
